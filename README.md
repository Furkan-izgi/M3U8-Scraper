# M3U8-Scraper
Python web scraper for downloading **M3U8** files designed with **Selenium** and **FFMPEG**. 
<br>
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/cody-k/M3U8-Scraper/wiki) for more detailed information!

<br> 

# Important Information
If requested I will add functionality to import lists of links from a text file, for now this scraper will go to one page and grab all the .m3u8 links avaliable.


<br> The variables in the image below allow you to specifiy locations of where your chromedriver[^1] is, where you would like your files to be downloaded to, and what url you will be scraping.  <br> <br>

This program assumes FFMPEG is already installed, however if it is not I have included a working version to go along with this web scraper.

# Notes
If you find any bugs that need to be fixed, feel free to contact me, fork this repository to improve it, or make a pull request.

[^1]: I have already included chromedriver versions 96 and 97 in this repo, this is only important if you have a custom location. If the version is incorrect you may have to download the correct version via https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
